### Hello there,

I'm software & machine learning engineer with +7 years of experience in the industries of payment and e-commerce.
During these past few years I've had the opportunity to design and implement solutions for enterprises such as Johnson & Johnson, Telef√≥nica and Imperial Brands across EMEA and LATAM. I've also founded and sold a payment startup [Kupay on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kupay) based in Madrid, Spain.


If you want to get in touch or think I can help you with your company's project, feel free to ping me here jafaguiarg@outlook.com.

Oh, and sometimes I write about architectures and implementations I find interesting here in my Github Pages, in case you want to take a look.
